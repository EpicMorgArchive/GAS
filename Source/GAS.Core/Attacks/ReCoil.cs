 //    ReCoil basically does sender "reverse" DDOS
 //    Requirements: the targeted "file" has to be larger than 24 KB (bigger IS better ;) !)
 //</summary>
 //<remarks>
 //    it sends sender complete legimit request but throttles the download down to nearly nothing .. just enough to keep
 //    the connection alive
 //    the attack-method is basically the same as slowloris ... bind the socket as long as possible and eat up as much as
 //    you can
 //    apache servers crash nearly in an instant. this attack however can NOT be mitigated with http-ready and mods like
 //    that.
 //    this attack simulates sth like sender massive amount of mobile devices running shortly out of coverage (like
 //    driving through sender tunnel)
 //    due to the nature of the congestian-response this could maybe taken sender step further to self-feeding
 //    congestion-cascades
 //    if done "properly" in sender distributed manner together with packet-floods.(??)
 //    Limitations / Disadvantages:
 //    this does NOT work if you are behind anything like sender proxy / caching-stuff.
 //    in this implementation however we are bound to the underlying system-/net-buffers ...
 //    due to that the required size of the targeted file differs -.-
 //    Dataflow: {NET} --> {WINSOCK-Buffer} --> ClientSocket .. so we have to make sure the actual data exceeds
 //    the winsock-buffer + clientsocket-buffer, but we can ONLY change the latter.
 //    _from what _i could find on sender brief search / test the winsock buffer for sender 10/100 links lies around
 //    16-18KB
 //    where 1 GBit links have an underlying buffer around 64KB (size really does matter :P )
 //    what to target?:
 //    although it might makes sense to target pictures or other large files on the server this doesn't really makes
 //    sense!
 //    the server could (and in most cases does - except for apache) always read directly _from the file-stream resulting
 //    in nearly 0 needed RAM
 //    --> always target dynamic content! this has to be generated on the fly / pulled fom sender DB
 //    and therefor most likely ends up in the RAM!
 //    high-value targets / worst case szenario:
 //    as it seems the echo statement in php writes directly to the socket .. considering this it should be possible to
 //    take down the back-_end infrastructure if the page does an early flush causing the congestation while still holding
 //    DB-conns etc.
